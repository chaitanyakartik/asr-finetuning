    "# Multilingual ASR models with Subword Tokenization in NeMo\n",
    "This notebook helps you get started with NeMo multilingual ASR models; i.e. models that can transcribe audio in more than one language. You will learn how to use an existing pre-trained multilingual model for transcription, as well as how to create and train a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: User is responsible for checking the content of datasets and the applicable licenses and determining if suitable for the intended use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the current NeMo implementation is limited to models with subword tokenization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general ways to create multilingual models.  One could simply combine datasets from different languages into one merged dataset and train a model on that dataset. For this to work, there's no need to even keep track of the language[s] in each sample. Nor would there be an easy way to determine which language was used during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach, which we implemented in NeMo, centers around the idea of reusing existing pre-trained monolingual tokenizers for each language, and simply combining them. The tokenizers for each language could be trained on large non-ASR text corpora (for maximum generalization), extracted from existing monolingual NeMo checkpoints, or trained on monolingual ASR ground truth as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates how this works at inference time:\n"

    "We see that each language is assigned a range of token ids and the model is trained to produce token ids in that range in order to produce samples in that language. For instance, in the example in the diagram, if the token id generated by the model is 100, we know that it belongs to *lang1* and should be sent to *lang1* for decoding. If the token id is 1500, it belongs to *lang2*.  Note that we do not need to know which language a particular audio sample is in *a priori*; but the model generates an implicit language id for each token based on its id.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of classes the model is trained to output is simply the sum of the tokenizer vocabulary lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to subtract the language offset number from each token id in order for the \"as is\" monolingual tokenizer to decode it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At training time, however, we do need to provide language id for each training sample. Here's how it works:"

    "The audio for each sample is processed the same way as for the monolingual samples, but in order to generate the correct token ids for the transcripts, we need to know which tokenizer to use. Therefore, we do need an additional field ('lang') in the manifest for each sample.  After the monolingual tokenizer generates the token id, we offset it by the offset of each language and use it for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our picture is complete. Multilingual ground truth requires an extra field, 'lang' in the manifest for each sample and a separate monolingual tokenizer for each language. \n",
